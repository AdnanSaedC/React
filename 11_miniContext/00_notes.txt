react does reaction on two things prop and state

now we have something called state management in picture ehich if you wanr a sub component o get the data the parent component need to have that data 

this was traditional approach this was not optimize and can cause rendering

to tackle this issue we have something called stateManagement in place

the entire thing we will have something called store(which is a database) all the data reisdes here and if you want to get the data or make changes you have to ask this things for that

here state aka context-api

all the component should have to access this component

so the goal is to craete a context , make sure each component is able to  use it and just consume it that's it

the problem was u have to send the data to all the component from the parent component
like from <App/> to <Login/> and that time consuming and fraustating at the same time
