what is create root method which is there on the main.jsx file
ReactDom.createRoot

it creates a DOM behind the scene just like what is there for browser
what is virtualDom
the Dom created by react is compared with the DOM on the browser
and then what are the changes required those alone gets updated

whereas in normal javaScript entire dom is kind of recreated

another thing for which react is known for is they update their algo
after some time using an alogo so that changes should be made in an optimized way

and preventing resource wastage


what is react fiber
it is an alogo used behind the scenes to make the changes in the react

it came to the picture because animation got a huge hit because
of reacts fast changes

the main ability is to pause,abort and reuse and assigning priority to
the changes

hydration is the process of includeing js in the web file and making it
functional changing from static to dynamic

this algo also improves hydration time

Reconcilation is nothing but an algo of react which considers
the update that has to made. it is mainly used to compare react tree 
with another tree(browser DOM)

and therefore it is used to decide which part of the UI should change

our job as the developer o just make changes in the state
the transition will be done by core react

this is the flow which governs the changes in react

there is a tree of your code right now
a change is made by clicking a button or something else
then a new entire new tree is created from stractch and then compared
with existing tree and changes are made


if you want to improve the performance of lists in react you ahve to introduces
keys in them and they should be unique 

you can also make the priority of your change much higher then what react 
will assign

The top four thing about fiber
abort
reuse
pause
priority assigning

if you are returning an html element then go far jsx else js enogh

the thing is react is a separate library which takes to react DOM in case of web pages
