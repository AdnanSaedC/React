how react works in nothing but in case of browser react talks to react-DOM and incase of mobile it talks to recat Native

core recat -> react DOM /Native

//the entire jsx things goes through React.createElement() function and becomes an object which gets rendered on the screen

in case of vanilla js for every change the entire browser gets repainted 
here in react we create a virtual DOM and we memick the OG DOM

and only the changes in being displayed not the entire html page

REACT architecture
prev react use to do thngs immedietly now they do things in batches to smoothen the animation

reconsilitaion

it is nothing but diff btwn HTML DOM and virtual DOM and only changing whats needs to be changed

thus reconsilitaion means comparing and finding which nodes has to be updated
and rendering is all about painting the picture

REACT fiber 
has 4 things
1 - abort the process not  if A git changed to B then suddenly into then stops changing into B
2 - priotize
3 - wait just wait before doing because some times state may get change
4 - reuse

like our body here everything is like fiber attached to each other
