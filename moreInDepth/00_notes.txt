Roadmap

react help us to manage complex front end application
in just a click u can change tons of things

react was created because of phantom problem 
which is the UI was inconsistent back in the day 
chages was not reflected in all the places

the core problem was all the variables was maintained by js and the ui is maintained by DOM 
and there was no sync between them

react gaved consistency in UI

how to create REACT projects

npx is used to execute node packages
npx create-react-app folder name for creating pure react app we will go with vite

npm create vite@latest

file structure of folder created using react
in case of react created using react not a bundler
you will have something called build which converts all your code into basic html css and js

//you have robot.txt file 
it is for google indexing and manifes.json is for mobile 

when u look at the index.js in the files it does not have a script tag 
then how js gets injected it happens through react scripts
incase of vite they are injecting in the html page itself thus removing react-scripts


//now vite
it also give build 

when you return a html in js you have to call use .jsx notations
use capital letter while naming a component and file name 


any change in state rerenders the UI
