why we need Context Api in the first place


consider a scenario
<GrandParent/>
   <Parent>
      <Child>
      
      </Child>
   </Parent>
</GrandParent>

look if you want to send something to the Child
first you have to send the data to the GrandParent
then Parent then child this is actual flow

now in this case what we are doing is we are telling
keeping a global storage file where everything is stored 

and each file can access data from that file 
so reduced the unneccessary data transfer by large extent

to solve this type of issues there are plenty of things 
available in them market which include 
context-Api
react-redux
redux-toolkit
