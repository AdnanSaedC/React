Single page Application AkA SPA

it is only thing where all changes reflects

npscript tag is used to display the stuff when js is not available

react is nothing but the core library and reactDom is the web implementation of react

react also creates its own DOM known as reactDom and it is also called as virtualDom
and it has a function called render

when u r working with pure react everything is done by react-script

lets see what is the case when it comes to vite
here they just directly import that in the html file

function name and tag name should start with a capital letter
thats mandatory in vite

you can only return only one tag
