the thing is react is a separate library which takes to react DOM in case of web pages
and react native in case of mobile apps

similarly redux is a state management library and it is used in recat through react redux
just like we need both react and react-dom for web pages

we nee' both redux (it is also a library) and recat redux to make redux work in react environment

redux can be used with any js app not only react

it is designed to handle conetxt api better

the only problem with redux is setup takes time just like conetxt api
to reduce the time required for setup redux tool kit was born an another layer of abstraction over redux 

reducers are the functions used to change the defination of functions


so the entiere story is create a store and then slice abnd then use useDispatch to put something and useSelector to get something

and use provider from react to wrap and store as a parameter to send the value

every application has only one store

in order to update the value in the store we need slice
which takes three parameters 
one name
initial state
reducers
